# CoffeeOrderingApp
This is just a normal app which helps you order coffee by sending the details through email to whomsoever you want to send it to.
Through this I learnt how to take user input in an app , how to use intents , constructors in java , how to use styles , nesting of layouts , how to use buttons , checkboxes and much more .
